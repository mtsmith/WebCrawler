                        <p>A brush is a tool with bristles made of hair, wire, metal, synthetic fibers, or various natural materials that are attached to a handle made of wood, plastic, wire, or metal. Some varieties of brushes are adapted to be connected to power tools for heavy duty work such as removing paint or smoothing metals.</p>
                        <p>There is an endless variety of brushes, from hair artist&lsquo;s brushes to brushes that are a couple feet in diameter used to clean floors and polish metals. The shape and design of brushes are adjusted to fit different applications.</p>
                        <p>Brushes are manufactured and produced to fit any application. Cylinder shaped brushes are used to clean conveyor belts and for the brushing of product substrate. Sanding brushes have bristles made of sandpaper to clean wood surfaces. Extra small micro brushes are ideal for gently applying cleaners to technical equipment and gluing small parts.</p>

                        <h2 id="how-brushes-are-made">Chapter 2: How Brushes are Made</h2>
                        <p>As innovative applications develop and designs change, new brushes are constantly being developed to meet new conditions. Though there have been many changes over the years, the basic design of brushes has remained constant with handles and bristles being the common elements.</p>

                        <h3>How Brushes are Made</h3>
                        <h4>Block or Handle</h4>
                        <p>The first consideration in the construction of a brush is the handle. It has to be made of a solid sturdy material that will hold the bristles in place but be able to take continuous use. The selected handle material is carefully inspected for any flaws that may weaken the strength of the brush.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/brush/cleaning-brush/curved-handle-scratch-brush.jpg" alt="Curved Handle Scratch Brush" title="Curved Handle Scratch Brush">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Twisted</h4>
                        <p>Twisted wire brushes are made by placing bristles between stem wires. The wires are then twisted tightly to secure and hold the filaments in place as can be seen in the image below. The length and diameter of the brush can be easily adjusted as well as the filaments. </p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/brush/cleaning-brush/tube-brush.png" alt="Tube Brush" title="Tube Brush">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Shaping</h4>
                        <p>After the molding process, the handle is shaped to match its final form for the completed brush. Every handle is put through a different machining to match its final contour and shape. Wire brush handles can be twinned or machined.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/brush/cleaning-brush/pencil-brush.png" alt="Pencil Brush" title="Pencil Brush">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Special Features</h4>
                        <p>The design of every brush is unique and has added features that makes the use of the brush easier. These features can include a loop on the top for handling and storage, grooves, or indentations to allow a better grip, or recessed bristles. Any additional characteristics are added to the handle to make use of the brush more convenient. The handle on the toothbrush style utility brush pictured below has special notches in the handle for easier grip and handling.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/brush/cleaning-brush/small-utility-brush.jpg" alt="Small Utility Brush" title="Small Utility Brush">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Preparation</h4>
                        <p>Prior to inserting the bristles, the handle has to be prepared. For brushes with wooden handles, holes are drilled for the bristles to be inserted. The same is true of plastic brushes, once the handle is shaped and formed, holes are drilled for the bristles. Wire handled brushes have the bristles twisted into the brush.</p>

                        <h4>Bristle Installation</h4>
                        <p>Bristles come in as many varieties as there are brushes. They can be made of vinyl, horsehair, plants, synthetics, polypropylene, and various forms of light metals. The choice of bristles is dependent on the final purpose and use for the brush. Though for many years, bristles were inserted by hand, and still are for certain forms of delicate or sensitive brushes, but for mass produced brushes, they are inserted by machine in tightly wound bundles.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/brush/cleaning-brush/various-types-of-bristle-configurations.jpg" alt="Bristle Configurations" title="Various Types of Bristle Configurations">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>
                        <p>The insertion process for placing bristles is critical to the performance and longevity of the brush. With some wooden brush handles, the bristle bundles are folded and stapled into predrilled holes. Brushes with plastic handles, fold the bundles, like wooden handled brushes, but secure the bristles by folding them over a small piece of metal. Wire handled brushes have the bristles twisted into the wire.</p>

                        <p>The uses for brushes spread across industries, homes, retail locations, and service industries. They are found in every possible location, whether it is the production of automobiles or sweeping the kitchen floor. Brushes have become an essential part of multiple applications. Described below are a few of the industries that use brushes.</p>
                        <h3>Uses for Brushes</h3>

                        <h4>Bakery</h4>
                        <p>There is a wide assortment of brushes that are used in the bakery industry that include bench, fryer, pastry, sauce, greasing, icing, and scraping, to name a few. The type and design of a bakery brush is determined by the bristles, which can be rigid and tough or soft and pliable. These factors decide how the brush will be used.</p>

                        <h2 id="types-of-brushes">Chapter 4: Types of Brushes</h2>
                        <p>Though there are many different types of brushes, they can be categorized as an applicator, material removal brush, or combing brush. The brushes in each group have design features that make them distinct and unique.</p>

                        <h3>Applicator Brushes</h3>
                        <p>Applicator brushes are used to apply a substance to a surface as a coating, covering, or means of protection.</p>

                        <h4>Artist Brushes</h4>
                        <p>Artist brushes have different bristle types, shapes, and densities, depending on the delicacy of the work to be created. The different types of bristles also require different handles for each project with stippling brushes being in a variety of diameters, while oil painting brushes are smaller and more refined.</p>
                        <h4>Miniature Brushes</h4>
                        <p>Miniature brushes are used to clean, paint, and polish and can be handheld or used as attachments to drills and power tools. Though miniature brushes are commonly used by artists, specially designed miniature brushes are used for industrial applications.</p>
                        <h4>Polishing Brushes</h4>
                        <p>Polishing brushes are used to clean jewelry, cars, shoes, metals, and stainless steel dishware.

                        <h3>Industrial Wire Brushes</h3>
                        <p>Wire brushes have metal bristles and are used for deburring, surface brushing, and parts cleaning. They can have a loop, plastic molded handle, wooden handle, or some form of other material to be able to grab the brush. </p>

                        <h4>Wheel Brushes</h4>
                        <p>There are several varieties of wheel brushes that include different forms of bristles and how the bristles are attached. It is difficult to place one definition with any form of brush since they come in so many types and kinds. Some wire wheel brushes are circular shaped and have a base or core attached to wire bristles, which are affixed in holes drilled in the core. They are used for industrial applications requiring continuous operation. They are exceptional as surface treatment tools.Other forms of wheel brushes, such as those used for power tools, have metal parts that are press fitted together to hold the bristles in place or spot welded for the same purpose.</p>

                        <h4>Rotary Brushes</h4>
                        <p>Rotary brushes come in a wide variety of sizes from ones that are handheld to ones that fit on street sweepers and runway cleaners. They can be found at the end of conveyor belts to clean off debris and be shaped like a cylinder or oval, depending on the use.</p>

                        <h4>Strip Brushes</h4>
                        <p>Strip brushes, that are made of long strips of bristles, are used to seal the space between and under doors or as cleaning tools.Their bristles are made of nylon, wire, or horsehair for its abrasion resistance and strength. Strip brushes are used as dust, moisture, or light barriers and weather stripping. They can be found in conveyor assemblies to guide products along the belt.</p>
                        <p>An unusual and unique function for strip brushes is in the equine industry to resolve an issue with horses. Some horses have a tendency to grip the top of their stable door and suck on it with their incisors, a stereotypical behavior referred to as cribbing.. To prevent harm from this behavior, a strip brush can be installed along the top of the stall door, which is a safer alternative.  </p>

                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Wood</h4>
                        <p>Wood is the most common type of brush handle, but has been gradually replaced by synthetics and plastics. It can be shaped and configured for any type of brush and can be coated for protection to increase its usefulness.</p>
                        <h4>Fiberglass</h4>
                        <p>Fiberglass is used as a handle due to its lightweight, non-magnetic and conductive properties, as well as its ability to be easily shaped and molded. It is used as a handle for a wide variety of applications.</p>
                        <h4>Twisted Wire</h4>
                        <p>Twisted wire handles are adaptable to handheld or power tool use. The sturdiness and durability of twisted handle brushes has made them an essential tool for several industries from metal finishing to automobile cleaning.</p>
                        <h4>Aluminum</h4>
                        <p>Aluminum is used as a handle after being alloyed with another metal. Though it is corrosion and rust resistant, it does not have the tensile strength to perform as a brush handle.</p>
                        <h4>Synthetic</h4>
                        <p>Aside from plastic, other synthetic materials are used in the production of brush handles. They include several polymer based materials such as polypropylene and polyethylene. Since synthetics can be shaped and produced in a variety of tensile strengths, shapes, and consistencies, they are widely used in brush manufacturing.</p>
                        <h4>Plastic</h4>
                        <p>Plastic is normally used as a handle because it is lightweight, chemical resistant, and has a long life. The types of plastic handles vary depending on the application.</p>

                        <h3>Bristle or Fill Materials</h3>
                        <h4>Hair</h4>
                        <p><u>Camel Hair:</u> Camel hair brushes are made from soft hair from a variety of animals and are a low quality, inexpensive bristle.</p>
                        <p><u>Goat Hair:</u> Goat hair is very soft with a natural kink and is used for short, soft bristle brushes like cosmetic and electronic industry brushes. It can easily be colored.</p>
                        <p><u>Hog Bristle:</u> Hog bristle brushes are scarce and expensive. Each bristle is tapered, which gives it resilience. The tip end is split and stiff. Hog bristles have excellent durability and water resistance.</p>
                        <p><u>Horsehair:</u> Horse hairs are differentiated between tail and mane hair with tail hair being stiffer than mane hair. The soft to stiff texture creates brushes with excellent durability. Horsehair is absorbent because of its tapered scales, which makes it useful for buffing, cleaning, dusting, and finishing.</p>
                        <p><u>Ox Hair:</u> Ox hair is the stiffest, strongest, and most resilient of the hair bristles. It is taken from the ears and has a springiness or snap like sable hair but has blunt ends.</p>

                        <h2 id="brush-manufacturing-regulations">Chapter 6: Brush Manufacturing Regulations</h2>
                        <p>There isn&lsquo;t one set of standards for the manufacturing of brushes since they come in so many varieties. Specialized brushes for the food industry, pharmaceuticals, and cleanrooms have to meet the standards set for those industries.</p>
                        <h3>Cleanroom Brushes</h3>
                        <p>Cleanrooms are used for processes where particulate contamination can affect the quality of goods produced. Cleanroom classifications and the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) class codes provide guidelines and descriptions for secure environments to lower product contamination or particulate interference. ISO standard 14644-1 for cleanroom standards are used to protect consumers from any flaws or mishandling of a product.</p>
                        <p>A section of the cleanroom standards outlines the storage and use of tools with specific guidelines regarding the quality and type of tools that can be used, including brushes, which must be manufactured using approved materials and processes.</p>
                        <p>Cleanroom brushes are required to be made from durable long lasting materials. Heat tolerant cleanroom brushes include bowl, vat, toothbrush style, and instrument cleaning brushes using nylon or antistatic nylon.</p>

                        <h3>Food Industry</h3>
                        <p>The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has standards that specify the quality and type of brushes that can be used in food preparation and cleaning. Brush manufacturers have developed materials and methods designed to meet the FDA&lsquo;s exacting standards, which include brushes for bakeries, kitchens, and meat processing.</p>
                        <p>The food industry is highly scrutinized, which forces suppliers to work diligently to ensure their products meet FDA requirements. The main focus is food quality and safety for the protection of the public.</p>
                        <p>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) has a set of European and international standards that are used to ensure food safety and provide preventative measures for food producers to identify critical control points (CCP) for physical, chemical, and microbiological hazards. Food producers must use HACCP principles in the regulation and inspection of their tools and equipment.</p>

                        <h3>Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
                        <p>The standards for pharmaceutical brushes match those for cleanrooms since cleanrooms play a vital role in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Standards for the pharmaceutical industry are set by the FDA and have stringent requirements for cleanliness and sterilization.</p>
                        <p>Brushes are produced using polypropylene filaments and metal free, chemical resistant materials. They are used for cleaning straight and curved pharmaceutical tubes, where aggressive scrubbing is required without damaging or scratching the tube walls.</p>
                        <p>As with brushes on a production line, pharmaceutical brushes are used to move pills during production, counting, and polishing without breakage. They are made from varieties of thermoplastics designed to be moisture absorption resistant to avoid the growth of bacteria and any other form of contamination.</p>
