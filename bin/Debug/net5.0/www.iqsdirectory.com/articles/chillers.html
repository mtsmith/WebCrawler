                        <h2 id="what-is-a-chiller" style="color:#05a34d">Chapter One – What is a Chiller?</h2>

                        <p>A chiller unit is a cooling mechanism designed to produce fluids that can lower temperatures by removing heat from the fluid. The type and use of a chiller depends on the required temperature and kind of refrigerant, which can be a liquid or a gas. The cooled fluid is used to cool a room or piece of equipment.</p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>The complete process can be seen in the diagram below from Thermal Care.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/chiller-circulating-process.jpg" alt="Chiller Circulating Process" title="Chiller Circulating Process"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>
                        <p>Chillers operate on the principle of compression of a vapor or its absorption. They are designed to provide a continuous flow of coolant to maintain a preset temperature. As the diagram demonstrates, it is a continually circulating system of fluid that lowers the temperature.</p>

                        <!--CHAPTER 2-->
                        <h2 id="what-are-the-uses-of-a-chiller" style="color:#05a34d">Chapter Two - What are the Uses of a Chiller?</h2>

                        <p>For many years, industries searched for ways to provide cooling for a variety of manufacturing processes. Though the basic air conditioner has existed since the beginning of the 20th Century, it did not seem capable of providing sufficient cooling for large spaces and production processes. Discoveries at the end of the twentieth century have created chilling equipment capable of creating temperatures for cooling processes for a wide variety of industries</p>

                        <h3>Uses of Chillers</h3>

                        <h4>Industrial:</h4><p>Industrial operations create heat through the use of friction, high powered equipment, and furnaces or ovens. To increase the lifespan of heavy duty equipment, a chiller unit circulates cooled liquid through equipment in order to maintain efficiency and productivity.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Industrial-Chiller.png" alt="Industrial Chiller" title="Industrial Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Work Environment:</h4><p>On the manufacturing floor, temperatures can rise rather rapidly when equipment is in full operation, which creates an unsuitable working environment. To protect employee safety, industrial operations use chillers to keep working conditions at the proper temperature. With the addition of an air handling unit, chillers can cool work areas with chilled air much like an air conditioner. Depending on the building, air cooling chillers can be on the top of the building or inside of the building.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/variable-speed-air-cooled-chiller-delta-systems.png" alt="Variable Speed Air Cooled Chiller" title="Variable Speed Air Cooled Chiller"><figcaption>Variable Speed Air Cooled Chiller from Delta T Systems, Inc.</figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Plastic Manufacturing:</h4><p>Plastic is a very temperature sensitive material that can be damaged by being too hot and needs to be properly cooled. The correct cooling temperature of a mold determines the quality of the final product.  Chillers are used to provide a cooling bath that maintains the quality of plastic products.  In the extrusion process, a heat exchanger separates the water from the extrusion process from the cooling water.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Plastic-Injection-Molding-Descaling-Cooling-System.png" alt="Plastic Injection Molding" title="Plastic Injection Molding"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Metal Plating:</h4><p>The metal plating industry uses high temperature electroplating or electroless in the plating process. The bonding of a coating on metal produces extreme temperatures requiring heavy duty chillers to remove the heat from the plated metal.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/anodizing-and-plating-chiller.jpg" alt="Anodizing and Plating Chiller" title="Anodizing and Plating Chiller"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Food Production:</h4><p>The food industry has strict regulations regarding the storage temperatures of ingredients and products. Chillers for the food industry operate much like a traditional cooling system for food. </p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Batch-Water-Chiller-for-a-Bakery.png" alt="Batch Water Chiller for a Bakery" title="Batch Water Chiller for a Bakery"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Power Generation:</h4><p>Power plants generate a great deal of heat to produce electrical power. Chillers cool components and processes by absorbing the heat they generate.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Power-Plant-Chiller.png" alt="Power Plant Chiller" title="Power Plant Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Medical Industry:</h4><p>Medical equipment requires precision temperature control. MRI scanners, CT scanners, and LINAC machines produce heat that has to be removed and controlled. Chillers provide a constant source of cool temperatures to ensure the efficient operation of critical equipment.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Industrial-Medical-Chillers.png" alt="Industrial Medical Chillers" title="Industrial Medical Chillers"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Pharmaceutical:</h4><p>Medicines require the use of chilled water in the manufacturing process and need precise temperature control. Chiller units have the accuracy and precision for the chilling process and can be central process chillers or compact process chillers. The four basic types of pharmaceutical chillers are reciprocating, screw driven, centrifugal, and absorption.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Pharmaceutical-Chiller.png" alt="Pharmaceutical Chiller" title="Pharmaceutical Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Laser:</h4><p>Laser chillers are designed to cool laser equipment or laser processes. For a laser to perform at peak efficiency, it has to maintain an optimal wavelength. CO2, high power exciters, and ion lasers have to be precise and accurate. They depend on a chiller water cooling system.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Laser-Chiller-System.png" alt="Laser Chiller System" title="Laser Chiller System"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Temporary Chiller Systems</h4>
                        <p>Nearly half of major construction projects have temporary HVAC systems, which are rented, installed, operated, and maintained to remove temporary heating, ventilation, and cooling systems. Builders and contractors use the flexibility of temporary systems to win contracts for their projects.</p>
                        <p>There are three common reasons for the use of a temporary HVAC system, which include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heating and Dehumidification – new construction during cold weather, when replacing equipment, or when a heating system has failed, and applications where humidity control is critical, such as data centers.</li>
                            <li>Ventilation – maintaining negative pressure or circulating air in a smoke filled area or positively pressurizing areas like large vessels or submarine cooling.</li>
                            <li>Air Conditioning – projects being worked in the summer, replacement of present system, or when the chiller plant has failed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The portable chiller below is an example of a temporary chiller that could be used at a project site. This particular model comes air and water cooled and has other features that provide excellent and exceptional performance.</p>

                        <p>Though there are a wide variety of chillers, the majority of them work on the same principle of removing heat. The most essential part of the process is the coolant or refrigerant, which holds more heat than water and aids in maintaining an efficient cooling process. Heat is removed from the coolant and released into the air.</p>
                        <p>The two main circuits of an industrial chiller are the fluid and refrigeration. The four parts of the refrigeration circuit are the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator, while the pump, filters, and heat exchanger are parts of the fluid circuit. All of the components of the system can be seen in the diagram below from North Slope Chillers.</p>

                        <h3>How Does a Chiller Work?</h3>

                        <h4>Compressor:</h4><p>The compressor takes low pressure and low temperature refrigerant and compresses it until it becomes a high pressure and temperature gas. Three of the types of compressors are centrifugal, turbocor, and screw.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Centrifugal-Compressor.png" alt="Centrifugal Compressor" title="Centrifugal Compressor"></figure><br>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Turbocor-Chiller.png" alt="Turbocor Compressor" title="Turbocor Compressor"></figure><br>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Turbocor-Compressor.png" alt="Turbocor Compressor" title="Turbocor Compressor"></figure><br>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Screw-Compressor.png" alt="Screw Compressor" title="Screw Compressor"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Condenser:</h4><p>The compressed gas flows through coils in the condenser, where air or water moves over the coils to remove heat from the refrigerant. Once the refrigerant loses its heat, it condenses into a liquid.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Condenser.png" alt="Chiller Condensers" title="Chiller Condensers"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Evaporator:</h4><p>In the evaporator, the refrigerant returns to being a gas, becomes very cold, and absorbs heat. It is in the evaporator where the refrigerant and fluid interact, where heat is removed from the fluid to be transferred to the refrigerant. Three common types of evaporators are copper coil, shell and tube, and plate.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Evaporator-Types.png" alt="Evaporator Types" title="Evaporator Types"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Expansion Valve:</h4><p>The expansion valve, which may also be known as a thermostatic or electronic expansion valve, controls the amount of refrigerant that passes between the condenser and evaporator and changes the flow based on the cooling load.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Thermostatic-Expansion-Valve.png" alt="Thermostatic Expansion Valve" title="Thermostatic Expansion Valve"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Fluid Circuit</h4><p>The fluid circuit or cycle carries the processed fluid to the item to be cooled and directly lowers its temperature.</p>

                        <h4>Pump:</h4><p>The pumping system circulates cool water, or a water/glycol solution, from the chiller unit to the process to be cooled</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Chiller-Pump.png" alt="Chiller Pump" title="Chiller Pump"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Filter:</h4><p>The filter is designed to capture contaminants, dirt, and particles that may enter the chiller fluid. They are also part of the air intake system.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Chiller-Filter.png" alt="Chiller Filter" title="Chiller Filter"></figure><br>

                        <h4>External Heat Exchanger:</h4><p>The purpose of an external heat exchanger for chillers is for use with materials that cannot come in contact with the chiller. They include submersible cooling coils, palte, shell in tube, and jacketed tank.</p>

                        <h4>Heat Exchanger:</h4><p>Though the condenser acts like a heat exchanger, some systems have a heat exchanger as part of the fluid cycle system, depending on the design of the system.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Heat-Exchanger.png" alt="Heat Exchanger" title="Heat Exchanger"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Chiller Energy Efficiency and Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV)</h4>
                        <p>Chillers consume a great deal of electrical power during the chilling process, the efficiency of which is measured by the energy it consumes compared to the refrigeration it delivers. The two methods for measuring energy efficiency are the Coefficient of Performance (COP) and the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). If a system has a high COP, it is operating at peak efficiency. This also relates to the EER. Most companies inaccurately indicate that their units operate at 100% EER or COP, which is not possible since it does not include a chiller’s load</p>
                        <p>The Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) is a better indicator of the efficiency of a chiller unit, which is a standard established by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). The majority of the time a chiller operates at below capacity, a calculation determined by the IPLV.</p>
                        <p>The IPLV rating includes an understanding that most chillers operate below their design rating most of the time. By breaking down the performance of a chiller at four different design loads, the final rating is a better representation of a chiller’s performance.</p>
                        <p>Since a chiller is one of the single largest users of electricity that can be purchased by commercial enterprises, it is critically important that purchasers have an understanding of how to measure a chiller’s efficiency. An efficiently operating chiller has a lower operating cost, which leads to significant savings for a company. </p>

                        <h2 id="types-of-chillers" style="color:#2f5496">Chapter Four – Types of Chillers</h2>
                        <p>There are several divisions of chillers based on how the refrigerant dispels the heat it absorbs, the type of compressor, and specialty designed chillers that perform unique and unusual functions. Due to technological developments, there have been improvements and changes to chillers making it impossible to have a complete list of all types of chillers.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Chillers</h3>

                        <h4>Water Cooled Chillers:</h4><p>Water cooled chillers are normally combined with a cooling tower and use a condenser water treatment system to remove mineral deposits. The cooling tower sends water to the chiller to be cooled.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/industrial-water-chiller.jpg" alt="Industrial Water Chiller" title="Industrial Water Chiller"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Air Cooled Chillers:</h4><p>An air cooled chiller absorbs heat from water and transfers it into the air and is used where discharge is not a problem. Heat from circulating chilled water is absorbed in the evaporator. In the condenser, the refrigerant condenses, releasing the heat into the air.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/air-cooled-chiller.jpg" alt="Air Cooled Chiller" title="Air Cooled Chiller"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Screw Chillers:</h4><p>Screw chillers can be water or air cooled and use a helical rotor to move and compress the refrigerant vapors.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Screw-Chiller.png" alt="Screw Chiller" title="Screw Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Scroll Chillers:</h4><p>Scroll chillers have a set of scrolls that are used to compress the refrigerant and operate quieter and more efficiently. Since they are environmentally friendly, they are becoming more popular.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/scroll-chiller.jpg" alt="Scroll Chiller" title="Scroll Chiller"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br>

                        <h4>Centrifugal Chillers:</h4><p>Centrifugal chillers use compression to convert kinetic energy into static energy to increase the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant. Impeller blades pull in the refrigerant and compress it.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Centrifugal-Chiller.png" alt="Centrifugal Chiller" title="Centrifugal Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Absorption Chillers:</h4><p>In an absorption chiller, a generator uses steam or hot water to change the refrigerant into a vapor, which moves to the condenser where the vapor is sent back to the absorber. The refrigerant vapor is absorbed by a solution, which condenses into a vapor to release heat.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Absorption-Chiller.png" alt="Absorption Chiller" title="Absorption Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Reciprocating Chillers:</h4><p>Reciprocating chillers use pistons and a chamber to create pressure in the refrigerant. They can have sealed or open construction with sealed units having all of the components sealed in a single unit. Since reciprocating units function like an automobile engine, they require regular maintenance.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Reciprocating-Compressor.png" alt="Reciprocating Compressor" title="Reciprocating Compressor"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Explosion Proof Chillers:</h4><p>Explosion proof chillers are designed for heavy duty use and must follow specific National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) guidelines in their construction. They have a special reinforced structure for protection against flammable materials and have to be specially ordered. The main purpose of explosion proof chillers is for the protection and safety of workers. Explosion proof chillers operate on the same principles as a regular chiller but with added reinforced protection.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Explosion-Proof-Chillers.png" alt="Explosion Proof Chillers" title="Explosion Proof Chillers"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Low Temperature Chillers:</h4><p>Low temperature chillers are for industries that operate below freezing and require chillers that can produce temperatures at – 40&deg; F. They are used for ice rinks, petrochemical cooling, chemical, extraction, medical, pharmaceutical and food processing as well as product testing labs.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Low-Temp-Chiller.png" alt="Low Temp Chiller" title="Low Temp Chiller"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Evaporative Chillers:</h4>
                        <p>An evaporative chiller uses the power of evaporation to cool air. When water evaporates, it becomes a gas. High energy particles leave causing the temperature of the surrounding air to radically drop. This process can be felt when air is misted into a room. An evaporative chiller takes the natural process of evaporation and enhances it through the use of technology.</p>
                        <p>The process of an evaporative chiller requires the use of a reservoir of water, a fan, and thick pads. The fan draws in hot air, which crosses through the thick pads that absorb water from the reservoir. As the hot air passes through the pads, the water on the surface evaporates and causes the air temperature to drop by nearly 20 degrees.</p>

                        <!--CHAPTER 5-->
                        <h2 id="chiller-maintenance" style="color:#2f5496">Chapter Five – Chiller Maintenance</h2>
                        <p>Though the basic mechanism of a chiller is substantially the same for all of the types, as with any type of industrial equipment, regular maintenance guarantees that it will perform according to its specifications. Manufacturers strongly encourage scheduled monitoring and checking of chiller components and provide guidelines for how it should be performed.</p>

                        <h3>Chiller Maintenance</h3>

                        <h4>Condenser:</h4><p>Heat transfer is a major part of a chiller's operation. Condenser coils can become clogged or have free air passage.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Condenser-Coil.png" alt="Condenser Coil" title="Condenser Coil"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Refrigerant:</h4><p>A chiller's ability to perform properly is highly dependent on the refrigerant. Improperly charged refrigerant can severely impact the chiller's performance.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Refrigerant.png" alt="Refrigerant" title="Refrigerant"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Water:</h4><p>Water used with cooling towers has to meet the parameters for proper water flow. Debris, dirt, solids, and contaminants can interfere with water flow and be detrimental to the chiller.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Cooling-Tower.png" alt="Cooling Tower" title="Cooling Tower"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Reservoir Check:</h4><p>For the best performance from a chiller, all of its reservoirs should be checked to be sure they have an adequate supply of fluids.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Air-Cool-Chiller-System.png" alt="Air Cool Chiller System" title="Air Cool Chiller System"></figure><br>

                        <h4>Temperature Check:</h4><p>Chillers operate at their optimum at 50&deg; F. Unmonitored temperature changes can be harmful to the operation of the chiller. For best results, a regular examination of the glycol inlet and outlet temperatures help in catching possible problems.</p>

                        <h4>Cleaning:</h4><p>All equipment collects dirt and dust in the manufacturing process. For peak efficiency, the exposed parts of a chiller should be regularly cleaned. Filters should be changed to avoid clogging.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;"><img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/chiller/Industrial-Fluid-Filtration-System.png" alt="Industrial Fluid Filtration System" title="Industrial Fluid Filtration System"></figure><br>
