                        <p>An environmental chamber is an enclosure used to test the effects of a variety of conditions on a product, component, part, or assembly. These highly technical pieces of equipment are capable of simulating the types of conditions a product may face while in use. The conditions in the chamber are controlled by a series of computer monitors that can rapidly change the conditions or slow them down to last for long periods of time.</p>
                        <p>The stipulations and requirements for testing are predetermined to offer the most accurate data concerning a product's performance in the types of conditions it would confront during its use. In most cases, the parameters for testing exceed the normal conditions of product use.</p>

                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/environmental-chamber/environmental-chamber/thermal-shock-test-chamber.jpg" alt="Thermal Shock Test Chamber" title="Thermal Shock Test Chamber">

                        <p>Environmental chambers provide manufacturers with valuable data for the improvement of their products and guidance in how to adjust products that are presently on the market. These technologically advanced instruments help industries produce products of higher quality and longevity.</p>

                        <!--CHAPTER 2-->
                        <h2 id="different-types-of-environmental-chambers">Chapter Two – Different Types of Environmental Chambers</h2>
                        <p>Environmental chambers come in a wide variety of sizes and designs in order to meet the changing demands of industry. In most cases, environmental chambers are designed to perform several tests in one cycle, which can be programmed to be completed individually or combined to occur all at once.</p>
                        <p>The two most important types of tests are those regarding temperature and humidity, which are the top two reasons for product failure. Environmental chambers have the ability to create any type of weather conditions from freezing cold to tropical heat as well as harsh conditions and hazards.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Environmental Chambers</h3>
                        <h4>Temperature Chambers</h4>
                        <p>Temperature is the number one reason that products fail. The types of tests that are performed in temperature test chambers are referred to as thermostatic tests. To test the resilience of a product against temperature variations, temperature chambers are capable of producing temperatures that vary between -70&deg; C up to temperatures in excess of 180&deg; C.</p>
                        <p>The types of tests in a temperature chamber may expose a product to the same gradient for days or weeks. Other tests rapidly cycle through temperatures to examine a product's reaction to the variations.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/environmental-chamber/environmental-chamber/climatic-testing-chamber.jpg" alt="Climatic Testing Chamber" title="Climatic Testing Chamber">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>Humidity Chambers</h4>
                        <p>Humidity is the second most damaging factor to cause product failure, which is produced by the combination of moisture in the presence of increased temperature. In most cases, humidity test chambers partner with temperature chambers since heat is a requirement for producing humid conditions.</p>
                        <p>As is true of temperature test chambers, humidity test chambers are capable of producing several climatic conditions. Tests can be performed in a static state without any variation in conditions or a dynamic state where conditions change either rapidly or slowly.</p>

                            <img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/environmental-chamber/environmental-chamber/temperature-humidity-test-chamber.jpg" alt="Temperature Humidity Test Chamber" title="Temperature Humidity Test Chamber">

                        </figure><br>
                        <h4>Vibration Chambers</h4>
                        <p>Vibration testing is completed using mechanical or electrodynamic shaking, which is usually done as part of climatic testing. The shaking can be vertical, horizontal, or along three different axes.</p>
                        <p>During the development of a new product, vibration testing is normally included in highly accelerated life tests (HALT) and highly accelerated stress screen (HASS) testing to determine the viability of a new product under the most stressful conditions. It is very common for vibration testing to be combined with environmental tests to determine a product's ability to withstand normal operating parameters.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/environmental-chamber/environmental-chamber/commercial-vibration-chamber.jpg" alt="Commercial Vibration Chamber" title="Commercial Vibration Chamber">

                        <h4>Stability Chambers</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of a stability test chamber is to test a product's reaction to temperature, humidity, and light over an extended period of time. A major concern for stability test chambers is the shelf life of a product to determine its lifespan and reliability when exposed to various environments during shipping and storage.</p>
                        <p>The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) has divided the world into five climate zones. When the stability of a product is being tested, the parameters are determined by the zone where it will be used and shipped. These guidelines decide the settings on a stability chamber.</p>
                        <figure style="text-align:center;">
                            <img rel="nofollow" src="https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/environmental-chamber/environmental-chamber/stability-walk-in-chamber.jpg" alt="Stability Walk-In Chamber" title="Stability Walk-In Chamber">

                        <h4>Salt Spray Chambers</h4>
                        <p>A salt spray chamber produces a highly corrosive environment that tests the effects of long term exposure to salt saturated substances. The temperature in a salt spray chamber must be consistent to maintain the salt spray concentration. For the greatest consistency, salt spray chambers operate at 35&deg; C.</p>
                        <p>Salt spray testing is designed to determine the stability of coatings and finishes when placed in corrosive conditions.</p>

                        <h4>Thermal Shock Chambers</h4>
                        <p>One of the concerns for many products is their ability to withstand sudden changes in temperature and atmospheres. When an engineer is designing a product, they have somewhat of a vision of the type of conditions the product is designed to encounter. To get a clearer picture of a product's capabilities, it is essential to create the probable conditions it may encounter.</p>
                        <p>To achieve that goal and to gain a greater understanding of proposed products, manufacturers give their products thermal shock testing. This form of testing is the most severe and grueling of the different types of tests. The test consists of putting a specimen through a variety of environmental changes in rapid succession with temperature variants of 30&deg; C every minute or more. This type of testing is designed for applications that will endure rugged duty.</p>

                        <h4>Vacuum Chambers</h4>
                        <p>A vacuum chamber creates a low pressure environment by removing air and other gases from an enclosed space. The purpose of this testing is to examine how a product or device performs in a vacuum. This type of testing is a requirement for products used by the aerospace and defense industries.</p>
                        <p>There are a wide variety of vacuum chamber sizes from ones that are the size of a room to others that can set on a counter. Instruments, gauges, and components that are designed for use on aircraft and space vehicles are required to be tested in a vacuum chamber.</p>

                        <h4>Altitude Chambers</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of an altitude test chamber is to test the resiliency of a sample in low pressure at high altitudes.  Altitude chambers are able to simulate conditions up to 30,000 m. Those conditions are combined with decompression and explosive testing.</p>

                        <h2 id="used-for-environmental-chambers">Chapter Three – Uses for Environmental Chambers</h2>
                        <p>Prior to the introduction of the first test chamber in the mid-20th Century, the way to determine if a product was sturdy enough and how long it would last was conducted by surveys, experimental groups, and exposing products to local climatic conditions. Those methods were time consuming and delayed presenting products to the public. In some cases, no testing was done, and products were put on the market, which led to a great deal of backlash.</p>
                        <p>Since the invention of environmental chambers, producers and manufacturers have been able to perfect and improve the quality of products as well as offer products with better performance and endurance.</p>
                        <h3>Uses for Environmental Chambers</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of an environmental chamber is to replicate the types of conditions that a product will confront when it is being used. Engineers, during the planning phase, attempt to predict the endurance and stability of their designs. Environmental chambers allow them to take their predictions and produce a facsimile of the conditions such that they can make adjustments and changes.</p>
                        <h4>Temperature Variations or Thermal Testing</h4>
                        <p>Temperature is the number one cause of product failure, which is the reason that most manufacturers test for its impact on their products. The data from a temperature test provides information regarding how much thermal endurance a product can withstand.</p>
                        <h4>Humidity Testing</h4>
                        <p>Humidity is the second factor regarding the deterioration of products. Moisture, in all forms, does significant damage to materials, substances, and products. This is especially true of humidity since it includes both moisture and temperature.</p>
                        <h4>Air Pressure Testing</h4>
                        <p>Air pressure can vary when a product is being transported, whether it is by air or truck. To determine the types of air pressure a product can withstand, it is subjected to several levels of air pressure in an environmental chamber. The consequent data gives producers a baseline for customers and an opportunity to make adjustments.</p>
                        <h4>Thermal Shock Testing</h4>
                        <p>Thermal shock testing is a form of temperature testing. During a product's life span, it will be exposed to various temperature gradients. In normal temperature testing, the product is subjected to one level of temperature over an extended period. Thermal shock testing moves the product rapidly through a variety of temperatures in succession without hesitation. The purpose of the test to examine potential expansion and contraction problems as well as help determine at what point the product will fail. This form of testing is considered to be the most severe of the environmental tests.</p>
                        <h4>Accelerated Aging Testing</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of an accelerated aging test is to determine the specific lifespan of a product. An accelerated aging test subjects the product to stress that is designed to mimic the aging process. Prior to the development of environmental chambers, the aging process was tested by putting a sample to use for extended periods. Test chambers are able to speed up the process and provide data and estimates regarding product's lifespan.</p>
                        <h4>Xenon-Arc Testing</h4>
                        <p>Xenon-arc testing is a process of exposing a product to cycles of radiation to simulate the types of sunlight a product will experience during normal use. A xenon-arc light produces light by passing electrical waves through ionized xenon gas at high pressure. The result is a bright white light that closely resembles the light of the sun. Xenon-arc testing is included in accelerated aging testing.</p>

                        </figure><br>

                        <h4>UV Weathering Testing</h4>
                        <p>UV weathering is another test performed to determine the effects of sunlight on a product. Long term exposure to solar radiation can cause a wide range of effects from causing clothing to fade, plastics to weaken, or cement to crack. The damage to products is caused by invisible rays called electromagnetic radiation, which are UV waves, the types of rays that are produced by the sun.</p>
                        <h4>Salt Spray or Corrosion Testing</h4>
                        <p>Salt spray or corrosion testing is designed to assess how corrosion will affect the performance of a product. The process of this test is to expose samples to a highly concentrated saline environment for a predetermined amount of time. The types of products tested include coatings, paints, and other products that will potentially be exposed to a corrosive environment.</p>
                        <p>Salt spray testing can also be part of the accelerated aging process when the timing of the application of the saline solution is rapidly advanced.</p>
                        <h4>Altitude Testing</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of altitude testing is to determine the effects of high pressure and vacuum conditions on a sample. In a normal environmental chamber, when conducting an altitude test, temperatures can range between -65&deg; C to 150&deg; C at altitudes of -200 ft to over 100,000 ft. Altitude testing is normally done for products that will be exposed to air transport or space programs.</p>

                            <li>Door – Test chamber doors are tightly sealed with gasket material that can vary from certain types of pliable plastics to various forms of rubber.</li>
                            <li>Insulation – The critical feature of test chambers is their seal. This is achieved by having insulation material in the doors and walls.</li>
                            <li>Walls – Test chambers have a steel exterior with a stainless steel interior to protect against contamination of the testing environment.</li>
                            <li>Windows – Windows in test chambers are normally made of a clear polymer and are double paned.</li>
                            <li>Controllers and Monitors – Controllers and monitors are the most critical part of an environmental chamber. They come in several varieties with ones that can be accessed remotely and have ports for USB drives. They help establish and control the pre-set conditions of the chamber.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="environmental-chamber-regulations">Chapter Five – Environmental Chamber Regulations</h2>
                        <p>Since environmental chambers are used in so many different industries, they have to meet the regulations, standards, requirements, and laws that apply to their industry. In the case of the medical and pharmaceutical industries, the agencies that oversee testing chamber protocols are related to both the government and regulatory groups.</p>
                        <p>The agencies that oversee and regulate the pharmaceutical industry include the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Pharmaceutical Discussion Group (PDG). These agencies have requirements regarding the sterility of testing conditions, packaging, and the shelf life of drugs and medical instruments.</p>
                        <p>Regulations for the medical industry are similar to those for pharmaceuticals but also include the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Each of these groups provide guidelines for testing industrial, scientific, and medical equipment.</p>
                        <p>The requirements for testing of military equipment are laid out in the United States Military Standards (MIL-STD). These requirements give specific directions regarding the testing and development of equipment for the military that include the design of the testing as well as its limits. Each time a new piece of equipment is developed by the military, a new set of standards are created for its testing.</p>
                        <p>The standards for the auto industry include those published by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), the Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE), and Underwriters Laboratories (UL). How detailed the regulations and requirements are relate to the organization and its goals. On the government side, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has safety standards regarding the testing of vehicles, which are further stipulated by each state&lsquo;s department of transportation.</p>
                        <p>The governing agencies for the electronics industry include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Joint Electron Device Council (JEDEC), and the Association Connecting Electronics (IPC). Each of these organizations specify the types, times, and limits of tests to be performed on electronics products.</p>
                        <p>The telecommunications industry has been guided by the Telcordia Standards, which have become the foundational values of the industry. In conjunction with Telcordia is the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), which is a sector of EIA.</p>
                        <p>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a private organization whose members work together to develop standards for products, services, processes, and systems. Their main focus is to ensure that the performance of products is consistent across all industries and producers.</p>
                        <p>The organizations listed above are some of the primary groups that ensure that product testing is completed as an organized and planned process for the protection of the public and manufacturers. The types of groups can be specific to a country or be international depending on the product and its impact on the market.</p>
